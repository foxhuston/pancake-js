The javascript edition!

N.B.: this code is mad ugly. But it'll be cool, soon!

Getting Started
---------------

Pretty easy!

1. Copy `app/config/config.js.example` to `app/config/config.js` and fill it out (there's only one blank field)
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run the program. I do `nohup node . &`
